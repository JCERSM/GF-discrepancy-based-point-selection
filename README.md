# GF-discrepancy-based-point-selection

A MATLAB toolbox for the selection of **representative points** by minmizing the **GF-discrepancy** of the point set in the **Probability Density Evolution Method (PDEM)**.

For solving the Generalized probability Density Evolution Equation (GDEE), please refer to [Process_Oriented_PDEM](https://github.com/Tree-Yang/Process_Oriented_PDEM).
